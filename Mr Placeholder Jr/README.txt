- Sprite Strips -
All animations are exported as 30 FPS sprite strips which can be imported into most major game engines.

- Spritesheet -
The spritesheet in the root folder can be imported into most major game engines and with that you can
rig Mr. Placeholder Jr. yourself to add new and custom animations! I'd recommend you to look for tutorials
for the engine of your choice if you do not know how that would work

- Note for Unity users -
If you want to use these animations with Unity you should consider using one of
these two packages to import the source files in the "Spriter2D Sources" folder.
